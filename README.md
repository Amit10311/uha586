===============

We have used ROS package [CrazyS](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS), aimed to modeling, developing and integrating the [Pelican](https://robots.ros.org/astec-pelican-and-hummingbird/) quadcopter in the physics based simulation environment Gazebo. 


The platform was developed using Ubuntu 16.04 and the Kinetic Kame version of ROS.
