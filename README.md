Simulation
===============

We have used ROS package [CrazyS](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS), aimed to modeling, developing and integrating the [Pelican](https://robots.ros.org/astec-pelican-and-hummingbird/) nano-quadcopter in the physics based simulation environment Gazebo. The contribution can be also considered as a reference guide for expanding the RotorS functionalities in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) field, by facilitating the integration of new aircraft
