Simulation
===============

We have used ROS package [CrazyS](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS), aimed to modeling, developing and integrating the [Crazyflie 2.0](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/) nano-quadcopter in the physics based simulation environment Gazebo. The contribution can be also considered as a reference guide for expanding the RotorS functionalities in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) field, by facilitating the integration of new aircraft
