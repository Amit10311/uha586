* Installation Instructions - Platform Windows

# 1. Install sketchup2018
---------------------------------------------------------

* Open the downloaded Installer file as an Administrator. You may need to see a security prompt and will need to give SketchUp permission to make changes (install) on the computer. This step may take a while, so be patient if it seems like nothing is happening.

* When the installation window opens, you'll have the option to change the application language and choose a different installation directory. Click Install, and the Installer will show a progress bar.

```
cd ~/1_Maps/CITYGML_1/sketchup2018
```
